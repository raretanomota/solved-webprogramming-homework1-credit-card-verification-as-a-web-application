Implement a credit card verification as a WEB application using ASP.NET. You will get the following information from the user:

    The user’s choice of credit card type to be specified using a <strong>drop-down list. </strong>      Card number, as a <strong>text box.</strong>




Write an ASP.NET function that checks the validity of a credit card specified by the supplied parameters containing the card number and card type. The function returns <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>, depending on whether the credit card name / number combination is found to be valid. If it is not valid, a numeric code is loaded into a global variable, which may be used to index into a global array of error messages as follows.

<ol>

 <li>“Unknown card type”,</li>

 <li>“No card number provided”,</li>

 <li>“Credit card number is in invalid format”,</li>

 <li>“Credit card number is invalid”,</li>

 <li>“Credit card number has an inappropriate number of digits” etc.</li>

</ol>
